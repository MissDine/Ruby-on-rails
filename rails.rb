# Ruby on Rails was created by David Heinemeier Hansson in 2004. 
# A web framework: A web framework provides developers the tools they need in order to build applications. 
# A Ruby Gem: At its core, Ruby on Rails is simply a set of Ruby code libraries, and since the entire codebase is open source you have the ability to review the framework to better understand how it works.
# An MVC framework: MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. MVC is a popular application architecture that helps developers naturally separate concerns and organize their applications properly. 
# An opinionated framework: one way Rails speeds up developer productivity is by enforcing strong opinions about how your code should be organized, from folder structure to file and variable naming.
